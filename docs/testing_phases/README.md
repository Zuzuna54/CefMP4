# CefMP4 Testing Implementation Plan

This directory contains a structured implementation plan for improving test coverage and quality for the CefMP4 Stream Processor application. The plan is divided into five logical phases, each building upon the previous phase to create a comprehensive testing strategy.

## Overview of Testing Phases

### [Phase 1: Foundational Unit Tests](01_foundational_unit_tests.md)

This phase focuses on establishing solid unit test coverage for utility components and previously untested modules. These tests form the foundation of our testing pyramid and ensure that the basic building blocks of the application work correctly.

**Key Components:**

- Utility functions (ffprobe_utils, retry mechanism)
- Metadata generation
- Metrics and logging configuration
- Custom exceptions

### [Phase 2: Core Component Tests](02_core_component_tests.md)

This phase expands test coverage for the core application components that handle file watching, stream processing, and data storage operations. It addresses gaps in existing tests and ensures thorough coverage of core functionality.

**Key Components:**

- Watcher
- Stream Processor
- Redis Client
- S3 Client
- Main application

### [Phase 3: Integration Tests](03_integration_tests.md)

This phase focuses on testing how components interact with each other and with external services (Redis, S3) in realistic scenarios. These tests verify that the components work together as expected.

**Key Integration Points:**

- Watcher to Main to StreamProcessor pipeline
- StreamProcessor to S3/Redis services
- Metadata generation with ffprobe
- Stale stream check and finalization

### [Phase 4: End-to-End Testing](04_end_to_end_testing.md)

This phase validates that the complete CefMP4 application functions correctly in real-world scenarios, including Docker-based deployments with all required services. These tests simulate actual user workflows.

**Key Aspects:**

- Docker-based test environment
- Happy path testing
- Fault tolerance and recovery
- Configuration testing
- Performance testing
- Observability verification

### [Phase 5: CI/CD Automation](05_ci_cd_automation.md)

This phase implements automation for the entire testing process within a CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing code quality and prevent regressions. It establishes practices for continuous testing.

**Key Elements:**

- GitHub Actions workflows
- Test result reporting
- Quality metrics
- Pre-merge checks
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation

## Implementation Strategy

The testing phases should be implemented sequentially, with each phase building upon the foundation established by previous phases:

1. Start with **foundational unit tests** to ensure basic components work correctly
2. Expand to **core component tests** to verify that the main application functionality works
3. Add **integration tests** to check interactions between components
4. Implement **end-to-end tests** to validate complete application workflows
5. Set up **CI/CD automation** to ensure ongoing test execution and quality

While phases are sequential, implementation within each phase can be prioritized based on:

- Critical components with high impact
- Areas with known issues or bugs
- New features being developed
- Components with frequent changes

## Success Metrics

Overall success of the testing implementation plan will be measured by:

1. **Coverage**: Achieve >90% line coverage across critical components
2. **Reliability**: Reduce the number of bugs found in production
3. **Confidence**: Enable faster release cycles with confidence in application stability
4. **Maintainability**: Create tests that are easy to understand and maintain
5. **Efficiency**: Optimize test execution time to provide fast feedback
6. **Automation**: Ensure all tests run automatically in CI pipelines

## Dependencies

To implement this testing plan, the following are required:

- Development environment with Python 3.8+
- pytest and related libraries (pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, pytest-cov)
- Redis and MinIO instances for integration testing
- Docker and Docker Compose for end-to-end testing
- GitHub Actions (or equivalent CI platform) for automation
- Sample MP4 files of various sizes and characteristics
- ffprobe executable for metadata testing
